-	Font sizes: don’t forget to revise (right now its ~100pt!)
-	I like your first picture but maybe you could rotate 90 so that your user isn’t scrolling so much to the info. This would just apply on a phone screen, though.
-	I like your icons! The pie is clever
-	I think there could be less space between each ingredient? Less scrolling again
-	Numbers/steps for the directions so that you can tell where each new sentence starts, because the large space between the two chunks of info is a little confusing
-	I think you chose a good font because it’ll be easier to read on a phone


I need to figure out how to choose point sizes. In InDesign, point sizes have to be really large to show up. But I made my file in pixels…the pixels that I looked up were the size of an iPhone.  I’m going to shrink the photo at the beginning and maybe add one at the end. I will decrease the leading on the ingredients. I will add numbers to the directions. I’m also going to try to use some bold for ingredients and directions to add hierarchy.
