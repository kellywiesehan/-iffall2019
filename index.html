			<li>Kelly Wiesehan, Communication Design & Marketing, Junior</li>
			<li>I am a BA Major, and I wanted to try something different than type and word and image.</li>
			<li>I have no experience.</li>
			<li>I want to learn how to design for web. Will we learn about UX? Designing apps?.</li>
			<li>When designing for paper, you have to make sure the information is legible at varying distances. For screens, people are generally pretty close already and are interacting with the work instead of staring at it on a wall.</li>
			<li>https://www.drinkseriously.com - This website is extremely simple! It's just a white background with few pictures and text. It's all very clean and easy to digest. The eye goes exactly where it needs to--there's nothing on the screen that isn't serving a purpose.</li>
			<li>https://buffy.co -- As soon as you get to the homepage, you know exactly what it's for: sheets. There's a picture of people wrapped in sheets and the homepage text describes a specific type of new sheet. It's very obvious what the company is about.</li>
			<li>https://www.soul-cycle.com - The homepage uses a video montage to make things exciting, and then there are 2 yellow buttons that ask you to either book a bike or to click if you are new to soul cycle. Because these 2 buttons are on the homepage, it forces the user to choose right away and interact with the site immediately, instead of browsing around to try to find information themselves. I like that these buttons are in your face.</li>
