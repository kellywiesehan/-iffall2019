			<content class="intro_content">
					Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the 'Red Planet'. The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.  Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.

					Mars orbits our Sun, a star. Maris is the fourth planet from the Sun at an average distance of about 228 million km (142 million miles). One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun, which is a year in Martian time and 687 Earth days.

			<h1>atmosphere</h1>

				<div class="elements_content">
					The atmosphere of Mars consists of about 96% carbon dioxide, 1.93% argon and 1.89% nitrogen along with traces of oxygen and water. The atmosphere is quite dusty, giving the Martian sky a tawny color when seen from the surface. It may take on a pink hue due to iron oxide particles suspended in it.

				<content class="climate_content">
					Of all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like, due to the similar tilts of the two planets' rotational axes. The lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice those of Earth's because Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being about two Earth years long. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about −143 °C (−225 °F)  to highs of up to 35 °C (95 °F). The planet is 1.52 times as far from the Sun as Earth, resulting in just 43% of the amount of sunlight.

				<content class="moons_content">
					Mars has two relatively small (compared to Earth's) natural moons, Phobos (about 22 km (14 mi) in diameter) and Deimos (about 12 km (7.5 mi) in diameter), which orbit close to the planet. Asteroid capture is a long-favored theory, but their origin remains uncertain.[197] Both satellites were discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall.
